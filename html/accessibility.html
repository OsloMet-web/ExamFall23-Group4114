<!--Accessibility-page
Short presentation of accessibility for your site. 
Test your site with an automated test. 
Write a very short text (about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. 
Tell us how you checked, and coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an automated test could tell you. 

 You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code – lack of images may affect your score.-->
